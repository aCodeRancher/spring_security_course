# BLiNC Event Planner README #

This is the Course Reference Project. 

The BLiNC event planner is a simple web application that will be used to
demonstrate the various security topics covered in this course.


# Project Details

The project is broken up into various chapters. Each chapter will cover
a single security topic for clarity. 

Some chapters will build on top of previous chapters, and this will be
clearly stated in the chapter summary, if this is the case.
