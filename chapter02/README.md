# Chapter 02: Getting Started with Spring Security


## Section Details
In this chapter, we'll apply a minimal Spring Security configuration to start addressing our
first findingâ€”inadvertent privilege escalation due to a lack of URL protection, and general
authentication from the security audit discussed in Chapter 1.

* Implementing a basic level of security on the Event Manager application, using the automatic configuration option in Spring Security

* Learning how to customize both the login and logout experience

* Configuring Spring Security to restrict access differently, depending on the URL

* Leveraging the expression-based access controls of Spring Security

* Conditionally displaying basic information about the logged-in user using the JSP library in Spring Security

* Determining the user's default location after login, based on their role
