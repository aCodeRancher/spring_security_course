# Chapter 00: General Security overview

## General Security overview
This is the Spring Security overview reference project for
the rest of the course.

### Authentication
Authentication is one of two key security concepts that you must internalize when
developing secure applications (the other being authorization). Authentication identifies
who is attempting to request a resource.


### Authorization
Inappropriate or non-existent use of authorization
Authorization is the second of two core security concepts that are crucial in implementing
and understanding application security. Authorization uses the information that was
validated during authentication to determine whether access should be granted to a
particular resource.
