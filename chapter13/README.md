# Chapter 13: Additional Spring Security HTTP Features


## Section Details

In this chapter, we will explore several additional Spring Security features that we have not
covered so far in this book, including the following topics:
> * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
> * Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
> * Synchronizer tokens
> * Clickjacking

We will understand how to include various HTTP headers to protect against common
security vulnerabilities, using the following methods:
> * Cache-Control
> * Content-Type Options
> * HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
> * X-Frame-Options
> * X-XSS-Protection
> * Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Before you read this chapter, you should already have an understanding of how Spring
Security works. This means you should already be able to set up authentication and
authorization in a simple web application. If you are unable to do this, you will want to
ensure you have read up to the Chapter on Custom Authentication, before proceeding with this
chapter. If you keep the basic concepts of Spring Security in mind, and you understand the
framework you are integrating with, then integrating with other frameworks is fairly
straightforward.
