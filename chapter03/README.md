# Chapter 03: Custom Authentication


## Section Details
In Chapter 2, Getting Started with Spring Security, we demonstrated how to use an in-memory data-store to authenticate the user. In this chapter, we'll explore how to solve some
common, real-world problems by extending Spring Security's authentication support to use our existing set of APIs. Through this exploration, we'll get an understanding of each of the
building blocks that Spring Security uses in order to authenticate users.

During the course of this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

* Leverage Spring Securityâ€™s annotations and Java-based configuration
* Discovering how to obtain the details of the currently logged-in user
* Adding the ability to log in after creating a new account
* Learning the simplest method for indicating to Spring Security, that a user is authenticated
* Creating custom UserDetailsService and AuthenticationProvider implementations that properly decouple the rest of the application from Spring Security
* Adding domain-based authentication to demonstrate how to authenticate with more than just a username and password
